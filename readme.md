Here’s a detailed **README.md** file for your simple calendar web app:

---

# Simple Calendar Web App

This is a **Simple Calendar Web Application** that allows users to manage events. Users can create, update, delete, and search for events using an intuitive interface. The app is built with a **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and follows a modular code structure.

---

## Features

- **Event Management**: Users can add, view, edit, and delete events.
- **Event Search**: Search events by title, description, or date with a user-friendly search functionality.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and token-based authentication (JWT).
- **Responsive Frontend**: A React-based frontend ensuring compatibility across devices.
- **API Endpoints**: Well-defined RESTful APIs for event management and user authentication.
- **Scalable Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express, integrated with MongoDB for database management.

## Environment Variables

The project uses the following environment variables. You will need to create a `.env` file in the **server root** directory and define these variables:

- **MONGO_URI**: MongoDB connection string
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET**: Secret key for generating access tokens
- **REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET**: Secret key for generating refresh tokens
- **PORT**: Port on which the server will run

---

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available and describes all endpoints, request methods, and parameters in detail. To view the API documentation:

1. Start the server by running `npm start` in the root directory.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api-docs` (or the deployed URL).

---

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- **React**: For building the user interface
- **Axios**: For making API requests
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation
- **CSS**: Styling the app

### **Backend**
- **Node.js**: For creating a scalable server
- **Express.js**: For handling server-side logic and APIs
- **MongoDB**: As the database
- **JWT**: For user authentication
- **Mongoose**: For MongoDB object modeling

---

## Setup Instructions

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### **2. Setup the Server**

1. Navigate to the `api` directory:
   ```bash
   cd api
   ```
2. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the `api` folder and add the required environment variables (refer to the "Environment Variables" section above).
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### **3. Setup the Client**

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### **4. Access the Application**

Once the server and client are running:
- **Frontend**: Access the React app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- **Backend**: API server runs at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
